the ebs multi-attach allows you to attach the same ebs volumes to multiple ec2 instance in the same AZ  which (the io1/io2 volume that has the multi attach volume ) performs this capability

each isntacen will have full read and write 

use case : achieve hihger appliction  availaibility in cluster linux applications 
           applications that require concuerent read and write at the same time 


note: you can attaceh the volumes to up to 16ec2 instacens at the same time 
      it MUST use a file system that is cluster aware 
      A clustered file system leverages multiple physical storage servers which simultaneously mount the file system so that it can be accessed and managed as one single logical system
