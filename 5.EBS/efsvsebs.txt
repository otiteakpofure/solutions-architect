ebs is only attached to one instance at a time except in the case of io1/io2 ec2 instances in which they can be attached to multiple instances
    they are locked in the AZ level 

    to migrate an ebs volume across az 
    take a snapshot of the az you want to copy, 
    restore the snapshot to another AZ 
    EBS backups use IO and you should run them while your application is handling a lot of traffic 

    EFS IS  network file system which can be applied to variousAZ AND ITRS ONLY FOR LINUX INSANES
