  data at rest is encrypted inside the volume 
  all the data in flight moving between the insrance and the volume is encrypted 
  all snapshots are encrypted 
  all volumes created from thr snapshot are encrypted 
  encryption and decryption are handled transparently 
  it has minimal impact on latency 
  ebs encryotion used AES-256
