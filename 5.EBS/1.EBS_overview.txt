                EC2 instance storage 
EBS volume 
AN elastic block store is a network drive that you can attach to the instance whule they are running , it allows your instance to persist data 
even after termination 
even if the isntance is deleted we can use the same ebs for the new instance 
they are bound to specifi availaibility zone 

and  can bemounted to one isntance at a time at the ccp level 


EBS VOLUME 
to communicate with the ebs volumes and ec2 instence is between the network cause its a network drive , it can be detached from on instance and added to another isntance 
it is locked to one availability zone 
ypu have to specify how many GBS AND iopS ( Io OPERATIONS PER SECOND)
YOU CAN ALSO INCREASE THE CARPTITY AND 


IN THE CLOUD PRACTIIONER LEVVEL , EBS VOLUMES ARE ONLY LINKED TO A PARTICULAR EC2 INSTANCE BUT IN SOLUTIONS ARCHITECT YOU CAN attach
TWO EBS VOLUMS TO ONE INSTANCE 

YOU CAN CREATE AN EBS VOLUME AND DONT ATTACH THEM TO ECS INSTANCE 



EBS-DELETE ON TERMINATION ATTRIBUTE 

The delet on termination attribute controls how the ebs volumes works on the ec2 instance 

the root volume by default is set to default delete but other volumes are not set to delete
