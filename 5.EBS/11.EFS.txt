managed NFS (network file system) can be mounted n various ec2 instance across various AZ 
HIGHLY AVAILABLE , ESCABLE AND 3TIME THE COURSE OF an ebs gp2 volume and pay per use 
they are like cdn used for content delivery , web serving , data sharing and it needs security group and its compatible with linux based AMI 
encryption using kms 

and it is standard file sustem on linux using the POSIX
you dongt need to p;an for scalability as it will automatically scaled on its own 


EFS performance sna storage class 
it has various perfrormance ans torage class 

1000s of concurent NFS clients , 10gb +/s throughput , it can grow to petabyte-scale network file system ,automatically 

PERFORRMANCE MODE (SET AT EFS CREATION TIME)
- General purpose (default): latency sensitive use cases (web server , cms ,etc)
 - Max I/o -higher latency , throughput , highly parallel (big data , media processing )

 THROUGHPUT MODE
 -  BURSTING -1tb = 50mib/s + burst of up to 100mbs 
    privisioned - set your throughput regardless of storage size , ex: 1GIBS for 1 tb storage 
    elastic - automatically scale throughput up or down based on your workloads 
     - up to 3gibs for reads and 1gibs for writes 
     used for unpredictable workloads 



     EFS STIRAGE class
     a. storage class which is a lifecyle management feature which allows fro the movement of storeage files after a certain number of days 
         standard: for frequently accessed files 
         infrequent access (EFS-IA): cost to retreived files , lower price to store 
         archive : rarely accessed date which data is acccess a few times a year 

         TO MOVE FILES BETWEEN STORAGE TIERS  LIFECYLYC POLICIES WHOULS BE CREATED SO AS TO SHOW WHEN A FILE WILL BE MOVED FROM ONE STORAGE TIER TO ANOTER 


    AVAILAIBILUT AND DURABILTIY 

    STANDARD : useful for multiple az 
    one zone: useful for where you want to use one AZ so using the efs one zone IA is good here 

    by using right efs stirage clkass save up 90%
