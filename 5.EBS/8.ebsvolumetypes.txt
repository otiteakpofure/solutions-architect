ebs volumes types are 6

1. gp2/gp3 are volumes that balances prices and performabce fir a varitey of workloads 
2. io1,io2 block express are hihest performance ssd volumes for mission critical low laenty and high-throiuhgput workloads 
3. st1 (HDD): low cost HDD volume designed for frequently access throughput intensice workloads 
  sc1: lowest cost HDD volumes designed for less frquently accessed worjloads

  ebs volumes are defined with the following size , throughput and IOPS 
   - when in doubt consult aws documentation 

   NOTE: ONLY GP2/gp3 and io1/io2 block express can be used for boot volumes 

                                      EBS VOLUMES USE CASES 


GP2/GP3 
COSTeffective sotrage , low latency 
system boot volumes, virtual desktops , development and test environments 
1gib - 16 Tib 

NOTE : THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GP2 AND GP3 IS THAT GP3 IS  the newest verison and can HAS the baseline iops to 3000 and throuhgb to 125mibs but this can be increased
to 16000 IOPS na and throuhgput og 1000mb , the size of thr volume and iops are not linked you can increase one and leabe the other


gp2  

 small gp2 volumes can burst iops to 3000
 size of the volume and iops are linked , max iops is 16000
 
 
 3 iops per gb means at 5334 gb we are at the max iops 


                                   PROVISIONED IOPS (PIOPS) ssd
THEY ARE USED for critical business applications with sustained iops performance  or applicatiosn that need more than 16,000 iops , great for databases
workloads (sensitive to storage perf and consistency )

io 1 ( 4gb - 16tib ): max PIOPS: 64,000 for nitro ec2 isntance & 32,000 for other 
                      can increase piops independently from storage size 

io2 Block Express (4Gib _ 64Tib ): sub-milliseceond latency 
                                    max PIOPS: 256,000 with an IOPs: GiB ration of 1,000: 1
                                    and supports the EBS multi-attach feature 



                                            HARD DISK DRIVE 
THEY CANNNOT BE A BOOT VOLUME 
 125 Gib to 16Tib 

they are throughput optimized HDD (st1)
           they can be used for big data , data warehouse , log processing 
           max throughput 500mibs - max iops 500

cold hdd (sc1):
       for data that is infrequently accessed (archived)
       scenearious where lowest cost is important
