to protect IAM , we can use two mechanism which is a password policy and MFA 

 set a min pass lenght , lowercase letter or alphanumeric 
 prevent password re-use , password expiration
  


  MFA 

  protect atleast your root account either an MFA device you can use virtual mfa or authy for multiple device  or yoiu can use u2f security key 

  hardware key fob MFA device  and if using aws govcloud you have a special key fob 

                                                                       password polic 

under account settings 


                                    mfa
in setting mfa , you can protect it using MFA AND YOU can do this by clickung secyrity credentials from your account under yur profuile at the top
