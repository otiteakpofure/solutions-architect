this describes as our ec2 instances will be placed within the aws infrastructure.
we dont get direct contact with aws hardware but we can inform aws how ee like our ec2 instabces to be placed within aws 

to do this  3 strategies willl be used 
a. cluster - cluster instances into a low-latency group in a single availability zone  (gives high performance with high risk)
b. spread - spread instance across undelying hardware (max 7 instancec per groupd per AZ) -critical application 
partition - spread instances across many different partitions which rely on differenent sets of racks within an AZ to 100s of ec2 instacne per grpupd application sucj as cassandar, kafta and haddoop



in clsuter pralcement group all ec2 instacne will be in the same avaialability zone , its useful for low latency , 10 gps of bandwith 
if the az fails all instances fail at the same time 

 use for big data job , applicaion that need low latency 

 spread - ec2 instacnes are spead on different hardwares and different az 
          used for applications that has high availability and instance failure must be isolated from one another 

          NOTE: LIMITED TO 7 INSTANCES PER AZ PER PLACEMENT GROUP 

partition: we can have instaances spread across many different partitions 

           each partition is speadk ad 7 partitions per az and can elad to 100s of eac2 instacen 
           they do not share the same hardware rack 

           each partition is isolated from failure 

           it is used for application with big data
