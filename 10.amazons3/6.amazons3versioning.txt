you can version your files in amazon s3 and it is enabled at the bucket level 
when a user uploads a file it will creata a version and when we upload the same file everytime it will overwrote the exisitng one 
so its good you a new version of your file so you wont overwrite the exisiting one 
as well you can roll back to get an older version of your file 


NOTES: any file that is not provisioned priort to enabling versioning will have version null 
suspending version does not delete the previous versions
