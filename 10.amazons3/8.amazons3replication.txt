   Amazon s3 - repliction (CRR & SRR)
   CRR = CROSS region repliction 
   srr = same region replication



   1. TO DO  a repliction between srr and crr we must enable versioning in the source and destination buckets 
   2.  IF WE do CRR , THE SOURCE AND destination MUST BE DIFFERENT 
   3. IF WE SRR, THE SOURCE AND destination MUST BE THE SAME 

   buckets can be different in aws accounts 

   COPying is asyncrhronous 

   Must be proper IAM permissions to s3 

   use-cases: 
         CRR -  compliance , lower latency aaccess , replication across accounts 
         SRR - log agggregation , live replication between production and test accounts 

                                               AMAZON S3 - REPLICATION NOTES 
1. after you enable repliction,  NOTE: only new objects can be replicated 
2. optionally you can replicate existing objects using s3 batch replication 
             - replicates exisiting objects and objects that failed operation 


FOR DELETE OPERATION S3
- can replicate delete markets from sources to target ( optional settings)
- delete with a version ID are not replicated ( to avoide malicious deletes)

There is no "chaining" of replication 
- if bucket 1 has repliction into bucket 2 , which has replication into bucket 3 
- the objects created in bucket 1 are not repliction to bucket 3
