   Amazon s3 - repliction (CRR & SRR)
   CRR = CROSS region repliction 
   srr = same region replication



   1. TO DO  a repliction between srr and crr we must enable versioning in the source and destination buckets 
   2.  IF WE do CRR , THE SOURCE AND destination MUST BE DIFFERENT 
   3. IF WE SRR, THE SOURCE AND destination MUST BE THE SAME 

   buckets can be different in aws accounts 

   COPying is asyncrhronous 

   Must be proper IAM permissions to s3 

   use-cases: 
         CRR -  compliance , lower latency aaccess , replication across accounts 
         SRR - log agggregation , live replication between production and test accounts
