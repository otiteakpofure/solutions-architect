provides only a few configuration of knobs 
it cost lesss to set up your own load balanceer but it will be a lot more effort on yoyr end and it is integrated with many aws offferings/servcies 

it is integrated with many aws services 


HEALTH CHECKS 
health checks are crucial for load balancer becuase they help to check if an ec2 instance is working or not 
the health check is done on a port and route 

if the ec2 instance does not respond with the code ok 200 , then the ELB will not send messges to the load balancer
