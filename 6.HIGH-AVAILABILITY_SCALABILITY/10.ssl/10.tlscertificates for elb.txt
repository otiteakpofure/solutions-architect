SSL/TLS
- An ssl certificate allows traffice between your clients and your load balancer to be encrypted in transit (in-flight encryption)
- to encryt connection we can biy certififactes from public CA 
- the load balancer users a x.509 certificate (ssl/tls server certificate)
- certtificares are managers using ACM 
- you can upload your own certificates 
 
 you can set up and https listener 
  but to do this you must specify a default certificate 
  you can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains 
  client can use SNI (SERVER NAME IDENTIFICATION) to specify the hostname they reach
  also it can support older ssl/tls certificates 


     SNI (SERVER NAME IDENTIFICATION) 
It helps to solve issues associated with loading mutliple ssl/tls certificates to serve multiple websites 
it is  neewer protocol abd requires the client to indicate the hstname of the server in which , the server will then find the correct certificate or treturn the default one
