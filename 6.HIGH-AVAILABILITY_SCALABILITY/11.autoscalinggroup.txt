 AUTOSCALING GROUP 


 the autoscaling group allows ec2 instances to meet the needs of web applications 
 this is done SCALING OUT (ADD EC2 INSTANCES )
 SCALING IN (REMOVE EC2 INSTANCES)

 YIU CCAN CREATE POLICIES TO ENSURE THAT ASG groups ensure instanes 
 when one ec2 instance fail another can rise up '
 and they are free 

 you autoscale with a load balancer 


  autoscaling group with attributes 
   A launch template withing your asg this can describe how they can launch ec2 instances, 

your asg can have min size , max size , scalling capccity and policies to describe the ec2 instances 

Auto scaling - cloudwatch alarms & scaling 

it is possiblr to scaled and ASG based on cloudwatch alarms 
for example , using cloud watch alarmas we can know when to scale out or in 




                                                           AUTOOSCALING GROUP HANDS ON 
when ctreating asg ensure that a launch template is also created , you can make a mix of ec2 instances type as dependent by you 
and yoy can set scaling policies if you wish  and they yo can set the asg group size 
you can register instances in target group through asg 



                                       AUTO SCALING GROUPS - SCALING POLICIES 
DYNAMIC SCALING: in this category we have a 

target tracking scaling; 
                 simple to set up 

            the idea is that a metric is defined and also a target value and when it is reached thre value kick 
            for example,  i wamt the average asg cpu to be around 40% 

and the asg will scakle out or in 

simple/step scaling 

   this is a kind of scaling that happens when we want to add some ec2 instances when a certain range is reached 
   for example when a cloudwatch alarm is trigged (example CPU > 70%) , then add 2 units 

schedule scaling 
   this is when you anticipate scalong and then you scaled when it is met 

preicitve scaling 
 it is whn you can predict what you can use anad then aws prodvides rersources based of these approach 



         GOOD METRICS TO SCALE ON 

THIS IS baedd of what your appliction does but some of them includes 

cpu usage 
network usage 
number of request to each ec2 insance which now determines whethet to increase them or reduce them 
any custom metric you set as well 

 ASG -COOLDOWN PERIOD 
 After each scaling or reducing , there is a cooldown period of 300 seconds and this can slw down your ork in aws to snrue this is reduced ensure that all 
 ec2 instances used are configuired properly 
 and in thos period aws does not add or removed any instance if this cool down occurs then ignore it but if it does not occur allow it to continue working 

     
                                                                     ASG POLICIES - HANDSON 

schedule action: this is based of you know how your schedule work so you scale it 
predictive action: policies based on past event so you predict usually with forecast 
dynamic scaling :  

NOTR:YOU CAN STRESS A LINUX SERVER TO CHECK ITS CPU UTILIZATION
