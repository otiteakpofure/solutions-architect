scalaiabilyt means an aappliction can handle loads by adapting 

there are two kind of scalability
 vertical scalability  (scle up/down)
 horizonntal scalability (elasticity) (scale out/in)

 vertical scalabiltn: means you needd to increase the zise of the isntance  used for database 
 horizonntal scalability: means incrase the number of instances  used for w


 non-distibute systems: database 

 disriuted system: web applictions/modern applictions 


                                      high availability
high availability usually goes with horizonntal scalability
it means you are running your applicarion in at leastr 2 data centers ( == avvailiability zones )
the goal is to survice the data center loss 


high availaibility can be passive which means    and van be active which involbes horizonal scaling
