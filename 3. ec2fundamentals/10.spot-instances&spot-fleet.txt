to understanding spot instance, you define the max -spot price  that wee are willing and get the instance while current spot price < max price we are willing to pay 
if the current spot price > your max price you can chhoose to stop or ternminare your isntance within a 2 miute grace period 

by stoping when the price reduice you can comeback to use it 

to avoid instacen being taken by aws you use a spot block although the spot bloack is no loger avaialable FOR 2 HOURS MAX




HOW TO TERMINATE A SPOT INSTANE 


YOU MAKE A SPOT REQUEST AND PRICES TO PAY AND WHEN IT IS VALID FROM there are two types of request that can be made 

1. one time spot request  :once it requested instances will be launched and the spot request will go away 
2. persistent request: it is request which allows instance to bevalide aslong as it is the spot request is valid ( from -to)


if you want to cancel a spot request , it has to be in the open state , disable or active state 


if you want to terminate a spot instance , you have to cancel it and then terminate it 




spot fleets 

it is the utlimate way to save money 

ot is equal to set of spot instances + on-demand instacnes
the spot fleet will try to meet the target capcaity with theprice constraints 

when the spot fleet reacheds your target capacity or price it will stop to launch spot instacnes

strategies to allocate spot instances 
lowest price : from the pool of lowest price
diversified : distributed acorss all pools 
capaicty optimized:  pool wit the optimal capacity for the number of instanaces
pricecapacityoptimized: pools with the highest capacity available , then select the pool with the lowest price (best chpice for most wprkloads)

spot fleet allows us to automartially request spot instances with the lowest price
