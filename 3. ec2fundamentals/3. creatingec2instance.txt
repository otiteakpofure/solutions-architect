ebs volumes : alwyas check for delte on termination and remove it 
when you laucnh instances ensure you restart it 
public ip 

private ip = for internal network 

  if you stop and instance and start it again it will change the public ip address 

  and the private ip a

                                                                ec2 instance type 

m5.2 large  

m = instance class 
5 = generation of the instance ( aws improves them over time )
2x = size within the instance class 

                                                         GENERAL PUROPSE INSTANCE TYPE 

T2 MICRO IS  general purpose instance types and with ther family of t 

                                                        computr oprmizied
require high processors , high performnace , machine learning , gamin server 
require good cpu ,,

all ctype of ec2 instances are good for compute peformNCE 


                                              MEMORY OPTIMIZED
This requires ec2 instance that requiress a large version of ram; 
they usually use relational and non-relational databases and optimized for business prupose and big structured data and they are of the famuly of R 


                                       STORAGE OPTIMIZED 

great for storage -intenzive tasks that require high , sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage 

use cases :

  high frequency online transaction processing system 
  relational and non-relational databases 
  cache for in-memorey data bases and start with i , d or h1
