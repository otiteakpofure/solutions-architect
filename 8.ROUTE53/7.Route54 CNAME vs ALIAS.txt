AWS resources such as (load balancer, cloud front) expose an AWS hostname 
for example , thishostname.com ==== thishostname.com

CNAME 
This points a hostname to any other hostname (for exampel , thishostname.com ==== thishostname.com)
IT ONLY WORKS FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN such as (myname.school.com) this is not a root domain but this is an example of a root doman (school.com)


alias
THIS points a hostname to an AWS  resources (app.mydomain.com === blabla.amazonaws.com)
this only works from root domain and non root doman such as the example given above 
free of charge 
native heatlh check in details 

 so for the alias , after specifyin ght recordname which is a domain name and the type of record in the value , you specify anAWS resource 


 THE TOP NODE OF A DNS IS SIMPLE .COM 
 unlike cname record , it can used for the top node dns namespoace (zone apex )

 NOTE: Alias records is always of type A/AAAA for AWS resources (IPV4/IPV6)
       YOU also cannot set the ttl becauase it is done by route 53
