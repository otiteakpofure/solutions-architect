                        ROUTE53 TTL 
The DNS TTL desribes all steps to ensure resolvers cache website for a given specific time and after the time the dns can request again 
for example , if you set your tll to 24 hours that means the dns resolveers willcaheck only records for that whole 24 hours and for instance 
you make changes to a website ebcause its still under 24 hours the resoursc wont be updarted till the 24 houirs passes 

TYPES OF TTL 

high ttl -24 hour 
-Less traffic on route 53 
- Possibly outdate records 

LOW TTL - 60 seconds
- More traffic on route 53
- records are outdate for less time 
- easy to change records 

except for alias records , ttl is mandatory for each DNS record 

in creating a ttl ensure that the record name is pointed to the adddress  in which the ip address will be pointed to
