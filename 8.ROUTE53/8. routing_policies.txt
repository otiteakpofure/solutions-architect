 route 53 routing policices define how route 53 responds to dns queries 
  routing 53 supports the following routing policies 
   - simple  -  route traffic to a single respurce = goinging to a single ipaddress NOTE: IF MULTIPLE IPADDRESSES ARE ASSOCIATED THE CLIENT WILL PICK ONE WHICH IS 
                the clients wants for example , having 3 ipaddress for one single dns name 
                 you cannot associated this with health checks 

                 to do this 
                 create a record 
                 and then choose th routing  this can have more than one ip address    



   -weighted -  controls the % of the requests that go to each resources 
             -  assign each records a relative weight 
                traffic (%) = weight for a specific record / sum of all the weights for all records 
        - weights do not need to sum up to 100 
        - DNS records must habe the sanem name and type 
        - can be associaetd with health checks
        - use cases: load balanceing between regions , testing new applicaiton versions 
        ASSIGN a weiht to 0 and this means the recods wil stop sending traffic to a resource 
        - if all records have weight of 0 , then all records will be returned equally 

                                  HOW TO DO THIS 
        - create a record and choose the routing policy and state the weight to the range of ip address you want 
        - in creatig these records , varuious weight classes will be given 

   - failover(Active - Passive)- 
            In the failover , there are two instances 
            primary - 
            secondary( disaster recovery)- IN THIS THERE ARE TWO EC2 ONE THE PRIMARY ECS AND THE SECOND ONE WHICH ALLOWS FOR FAILOVER     





   - latency based : this is used for when you want to redirect traffic to the lowest latency to a resource closest to us
                   - super helpful when latecny is the major priority 
                   - latency is based on traffic between aws users and the aws regions 
                   - uses may be rediretced to varius rregions based of its latency 
                   - can be associated with health checks
