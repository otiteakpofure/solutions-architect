Discussing advanced concepts of Aurora 

                            AURORA REPLICAS - AUTO SCALING
 in autosaclling for example you are getting alot of read request to your database but by using aurora autoscaling , it will autoscaled to meet the request 
 for meeting the reader endpoint

                              aurora- custom endpoint
in creating subset endpiint using aurora you create custom replicas from the one that was given to you , and this allows you to create custommendpoint
and then the reader endpoint is ignored but it is it there and thos custom endpoint can allow you to run analytical queries 

                     aurora serverless

this is the type of aurora databsses that is based of pay per usage anad as such you do not need to plan provisioning of the instances 

                                          global aurora
in the global aurora 

the aurora cross region read replicas is set up which is useful for disaster recovery 
                                                                     simple to put in place 


aurora global database 
1 primary region for read/write
up to 5 seconday( read-only) regions whith replication lag less than 1 second 
up to 16 read replicas per secondary region '
helps fir decresing latency 
prmoting anther region for disaster recovery 
it takes less than 1 second to replicate data 


                          auro machine/learning 
enables you to add ML based predictions to your applicactions via SQL 
simple, optimized and secure integration between aurora and aws ml servics 

the supported servics 

 amazon sage maker which allows for any ML MODEL IN THE BACK END 
 AMAZON COMPREHEND which is used for sentiment analysis 

 use cases : for fraud detection , ads targeting , sentiment analysis and product recomendations
