read rrplicas allows you to increas th number of reads that your application needs to run its datbase services for example, you have an application that has too many reads and youw ant 
that application to be consitent the use of read replicas allows you to read frommthr main databses while creating other database services

in this situation there can be a manindatabses and then theri replicas databses which is aynchronously connected to the main databses and therefore 
thius databses can klater be promoiited to their own databasea as needed.  they cajnbe within the same az , cross az or cross region  


RDS READ RERPLICAS

THE REASON FOR READ REPLICEFS IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE  databses that peforms various read operations  and now yiou want to perform another operation 
on that database whic may destroy the way the databse work or the way the databse manage operations you can create a read replicas to still allow the databse work while the new read replice database answers your new request 

this read replicas only WORK for SELECT Wwhihc is equals to READ STATEMENTS and not insert, update or delete statements 

RDS READ RERPLICAS - NETWORK COST 
IN READ replicas, if you are transfer replices within two different AZ under the same reagion for read processes it will be free 
but if you are sending read replicaes from one region to another , then it will cost 


RDS READ RERPLICAS - (DISASTER RECOVERY)

note : mulit AZ is uded for disaster recovery 

yu can set up your read replicas to be in multi AZ  and as such transfer data between various AZ 


HOW TO MAKE A RDS FROM SINGLE AZ TO MULTIAZ 

TO DO THAT CLICK ON MODIFY ON THE DATABASE AND CHANGE THE TO MULTI AZ
