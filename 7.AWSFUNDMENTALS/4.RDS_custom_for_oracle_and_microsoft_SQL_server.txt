                                    RDS CUSTOM 
NOTE: with rds we do not have any access to any underlying OS or any customization, but now with rds custom 

and the rds CUSTOM is for RDS oracle and microsfot sql server 

with rds custom we can do the following
- connect using ssh 
- change configiration setting using the os and underlying database 
- intsall patches 


NOTE: To perform RDS custom , it is better we do the following 
   a. deactivate automation mode 
   b. take a snapshot of the database


                                              RDS VS RDS CUSTOM
        RDS: gives entire database and the OS to be manageed by aws 
        rds CUSTOM: full admin access to the underlying database and OS
