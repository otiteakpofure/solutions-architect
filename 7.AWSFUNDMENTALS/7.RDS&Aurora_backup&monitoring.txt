RDS & AURORA RESTORE OPIOTS

Restoring a RDS /Aurora backup or a snapshot creates a new database 

RESTORING MSQL RDS Database from s3 
 -create a backup of your on-premises databses 
 - store it on amazon s3 (object storage)
 - restoring the backup file into a new RDS instance running mysql

 RESTORING MYSQL AURORA CLUSTER FROM S3 
 - create a backup of your on-premises databses using percona xtrabackup 
 -store the backup file on amazao s3 (object storage)
 -restore the backup file on to a new aurorar ckuster running mysql 



 AURORA DATABASE CLONING 
 FOR EXAMPLE , YOU HAVE AN AURORA DATABASE AND you want to clone it into a new db so that the original datanse wont be hruts these have the following advantages 
 - it is faster snapashort and easy to restore 
 - it uses a cipy-on-write protocol 
   -iniitirally the new DB cluster uses the same data volume as the original DB cluster(fast aned efficient - no copying is needed)
   - when updates are made ti the new DB cluster data, then adddional storage is alloated and data is copied to be seperated 

   it is very fast and cost effective 


   NOTE: IT IS USEFUL FOR CREATING A STAGING DATABASE without harming the original DB cluster
