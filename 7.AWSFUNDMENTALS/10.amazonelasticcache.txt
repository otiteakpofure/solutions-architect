A cookie is a file that stores information that identifies an entity. Meanwhile, caching saves parts of a website in order to help it load faster on your next visit
The same way RDS is to get managed relational databases 
Elasticache is to get managed redis or memached 
cahces are in-memory databases with really high performance , low latency 
helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads 
helps makes your appliction stateless 
aws takec care of os maintenance / patching , optimizations, setup , configuration, monitoring , failure recovery and backups 
using elastic cache INVOLVES HEAVY CODE APPLICATION CODE CHANGES 


                                    solution architecture - DB CACHE 
Applications queries elastic cache and not the databse for queeires 
if an appliction has not cached an older queires before , it alks to the databse but if it has cached a query before it goes to the elastic cache 
instead of the DB 


                              USER SESSION STORE 

IN user session store under elastic cache is this a user logs inot the appliction then information of the user is stored 
THIS IS HOW IT WORKS 
- The user logs into any of the Application
- the appliction writes the session data into elastic cache 
- the user hits another instance of our applicaction
- the instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in 



                                          ELASTIC CACHE  REDIS VS MEMCHACHED 

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEM REDIS AND MEMCHED IS THAT REDIS SUPPROTS 
-high vaialbilyt 
- data restoration 
- persistence
- data backup
- read replicas to scale  reads and high availability 


                                                   ELASTIC CAHCE HANDSON

IN THIS STEP YOU DESIGN YOUR CACHE

                                      ELASTIC CACHE SECURITY 

Elastic cache supports IAM authentication for REDIS 
IAM policies on elastic cache are only used for AWS API-level security 

REDUS AUTH 
- you can set a " password/token" when you create a redis cluster 
-  this is an extra level of security for your cache (on top of security groups)
- SUpport SSL in flight encryption

MEMCHACHED 
  support SASL-based authentication 


  PATTERNS FOR ELASTIC CACHE
  LAZY LOADING: is when all the red data are downloaded from a website or internt serviecs and them they become okd under the cache table 
  WRITE THROUGH: Adds or update data in the cache when written to a DB (no stale table)
  SESSION STORE: store temporary session data in the cache when (using ttl features)



  REDIS USE CASES 
  - CREAING GAMING LEADERBOARDS 
  - redis does this through its sorted sets
