Aurora is a properitory technology for AWS (NOT OPEN SOURCED)
postgres and mysql are both supported as aurora db (that means your drivers will work as if aurora was a postgres or my swl database)
auro is aws optimized anc claims 5X performance improvement over mysql on rds and over 3x performance of postgress on rds 
aurora storage automatically grows in increment of 10 gb up to 128tb
aurora can have up to 15 replicas and the replication process is faster than my sql (sub 10ms replicas lag)
failover in aurora is instantaneuos . its HA active 
aurora cost more than RDS (20% more) buts its more efficient 


                         AURORA HIGH AVAILABILITY AND READ SCALING 

6 COPIES OF YOUR DATA ACROSS 3 AZ:
  4 copies out of 6 needed for writes 
  3 copies out of 6 need for reads 
  self healing with peer-to-peer replication 
  storage is striped across 100s of volumes 

one Aurora instance takes write (master)
Automated failober for master in less than 30 seconds

master + up to 15 Aurora read replicas 
support for cross region replication 


                                      AURORA DB CLUSTER

In aurora working as a cluster , it invloves various things

1. a writer endpoint is provided and this writer endpoint is what people use to talk to their clients 
2.  when the master db fails regardless,  the client can still talk to the writer endpoint 


reader enpooint: this allows the client to connect to the read replicas allowing for load balancing 

 featire of aurora 
 - automatic failover
 - backup and recovery 
 -isolation and security 
 - industry compliance 
 - advanced monitioring 
 backtrack - allow you resstored data at any point in time 
 routine maintenenac 




                                                        AMAZON AURORA DB HANDSON 

When creating aurora capacity range, you need to choose serverless so this is a secod time of instanc which a

when the aurorar databses is created there is usually , writer instance and the reader instance 

these instances are endpoint and it what the client will use to connect to the endpoint of the aurora database 

NOTE: WE CAN ALSO ADD MORE READERS and also creatd a cross region replica 

we can also creata a policy whicb


NOTE: YOU CAN ADD AWS REGION WHEN YOU SET THE DATABSES GLOBAL
