amazon s3- presigned urls

The use of presigned urls is simple

for example you create a prive s3 bucket and that you want somebody to have access to that private bucket , you can tgiove the person 
a presigned url and this gives the person acces to these buckets 


The presigned url 

allows users to genrate a pre-signed URLs using the s3 console , AWS CLI or SDK URL expirartion 

URL expirartion:
 s3 - console = 1 min up to 720 minutes (12 hours)
 aws cli - cofigure expiration with --expires- in paramters in seconds ( default 3600 sec, max 604800 secs = 168 hours )

 users are given a pre-signe url and then they inherit the same privileges as the owneer of the acccount but they can only perform GET and PUT actions
